## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow existing code conventions in the project
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Maintain clean, readable code

### Testing
- Run tests before committing changes
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass

### Git Workflow
- Create descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Review changes before committing

## Commit Convention and Pull Request Guidelines

### Commit Message Format
Follow the conventional commits specification:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (updating dependencies, build process, etc.)
- `perf`: Performance improvements

**Examples:**
```
feat(agents): add backend development agent
fix(setup): handle existing file conflicts during installation
docs: update agent selection instructions in README
refactor(cli): extract agent parsing into separate module
chore(deps): update inquirer to 9.2.0
```

### Pull Request Guidelines

**PR Title**: Use the same format as commit messages

**PR Description Template:**
```markdown

## Agents
See @agents/README.md for available agents and their purposes

### Agent Orchestration Workflow

For complex tasks requiring multiple specialized agents, use the orchestrator agent to coordinate workflows:

1. **Start with Orchestration**: For multi-faceted tasks, begin with:
   ```
   "Use the orchestrator agent to help me build a user authentication system"
   ```

2. **Orchestration Patterns**:
   - **Sequential**: Tasks with dependencies (design → implement → test)
   - **Parallel**: Independent tasks (frontend + backend development)
   - **Iterative**: Refinement cycles (code → review → fix → verify)

3. **Example Workflows**:
   ```
   # Full-stack feature
   Orchestrator → Planner (architecture) → Backend (API) → Frontend (UI) → Checker (review)
   
   # Bug fix workflow
   Orchestrator → Researcher (investigate) → Coder (fix) → Checker (verify)
   ```

4. **Best Practices**:
   - Let the orchestrator manage agent coordination
   - Use todos to track multi-agent progress
   - Provide clear context between agent handoffs

## Tickets
See @tickets/README.md for ticket format and management approach

## Plans
See @plans/README.md for planning documents and architectural decisions

## Development Context 

- See @docs/ROADMAP.md for current status and next steps
- Task-based development workflow with tickets in `/tickets` directory
- Use `/plans` directory for architectural decisions and implementation roadmaps

## Important Instructions

Before starting any task:
1. **Confirm understanding**: Always confirm you understand the request and outline your plan before proceeding
2. **Ask clarifying questions**: Never make assumptions - ask questions when requirements are unclear
3. **Create planning documents**: Before implementing any code or features, create a markdown file documenting the approach
4. **Use plans directory**: When discussing ideas or next steps, create timestamped files in the plans directory (e.g., `plans/next-steps-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.md`) to maintain a record of decisions
5. **No code comments**: Never add comments to any code you write - code should be self-documenting
