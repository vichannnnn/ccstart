# Claude Code Project Instructions

## Project Overview
<!-- auto-generated-start:overview -->
ccstart is a quick setup tool for Claude Code projects that provides a well-organized structure with built-in AI agents, ticket system, planning tools, and agent orchestration workflows. It creates a comprehensive boilerplate that helps developers quickly initialize projects with best practices for AI-assisted development using Claude Code.
<!-- auto-generated-end:overview -->

## Key Objectives
<!-- auto-generated-start:objectives -->
- Provide a quick and easy way to initialize Claude Code projects with best practices
- Include pre-configured AI agents (planner, coder, checker, researcher, etc.) for specialized tasks
- Offer built-in ticket tracking and project planning systems
- Enable agent orchestration workflows for common development patterns
- Support interactive agent selection and conflict resolution during setup

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow existing code conventions in the project
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Maintain clean, readable code

### Testing

- Run tests before committing changes
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass

### Git Workflow

- Create descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Review changes before committing

## Commit Convention and Pull Request Guidelines

### Commit Message Format
Follow the conventional commits specification:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (updating dependencies, build process, etc.)
- `perf`: Performance improvements

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality
fix(api): handle null values in user response
docs: update API documentation for book endpoints
refactor(frontend): extract BookTable into separate components
chore(deps): update FastAPI to 0.104.1
```

### Pull Request Guidelines

**PR Title**: Use the same format as commit messages

**PR Description Template:**
```markdown

## Important Context

[Add any project-specific context, dependencies, or requirements here]

## Agents

See @claude/agents/README.md for available agents and their purposes

## Agent Orchestration

After adding the agents you want to in `./claude/agents` folder, setup the workflow for Claude code to follow

## Custom Commands

Custom slash commands are available in `.claude/commands/`:
- **/update-claude-md** - Automatically updates this file with project-specific information
- See `.claude/commands/README.md` for creating your own commands

## Tickets

See @claude/tickets/README.md for ticket format and management approach

### Ticket Management
- **Ticket List**: Maintain @claude/tickets/ticket-list.md as a centralized index of all tickets
- **Update ticket-list.md** whenever you:
  - Create a new ticket (add to appropriate priority section)
  - Change ticket status (update emoji and move if completed)
  - Complete a ticket (move to completed section with date)
- **Status Emojis**: ðŸ”´ Todo | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | ðŸŸ¢ Done | ðŸ”µ Blocked | âš« Cancelled

## Plans

See @claude/plans/README.md for planning documents and architectural decisions

## Development Context

- See @claude/docs/ROADMAP.md for current status and next steps
- Task-based development workflow with tickets in `claude/tickets` directory
- Use `claude/plans` directory for architectural decisions and implementation roadmaps

## Important Instructions

Before starting any task:

1. **Confirm understanding**: Always confirm you understand the request and outline your plan before proceeding
2. **Ask clarifying questions**: Never make assumptions - ask questions when requirements are unclear
3. **Create planning documents**: Before implementing any code or features, create a markdown file documenting the approach
4. **Use plans directory**: When discussing ideas or next steps, create timestamped files in the plans directory (e.g., `claude/plans/next-steps-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.md`) to maintain a record of decisions
5. **No code comments**: Never add comments to any code you write - code should be self-documenting
6. **Maintain ticket list**: Always update @claude/tickets/ticket-list.md when creating, updating, or completing tickets to maintain a clear project overview

## Additional Notes
<!-- auto-generated-start:notes -->
**Technology Stack:**
- Node.js CLI application
- Jest for testing
- @inquirer/checkbox for interactive agent selection
- No build process required - runs directly with Node.js

**Key Features:**
- Interactive agent selection during setup
- Automatic workflow detection via hooks
- Conflict resolution for existing files
- Dry run mode for previewing changes
- Force mode for automated workflows
- Pre-configured agent orchestration workflows

**Development Workflow:**
This is the ccstart tool itself, not a project created by ccstart. When developing:
1. Use `npm link` for local testing
2. Test changes by running `ccstart` in test directories
3. Run tests with `npm test` before committing
4. Update version in package.json before publishing

**Available Agents:**
- planner: Strategic planning and architectural decisions
- coder: Implementation and bug fixes
- checker: Quality assurance and testing
- researcher: Information gathering from codebases and online
- frontend: UI/UX development
- backend: Server-side development
- blockchain: Web3 and smart contract development
- shadcn: shadcn/ui component implementation
