# TICKET-003: Implement Workflow Automation Commands

## Description
Create slash commands that automatically execute agent orchestration workflows, eliminating the need for manual agent sequencing and making workflows truly automated.

## Problem Statement
- Agent orchestration workflows are currently just documentation/guidelines
- Users must manually invoke each agent in sequence
- No automatic execution of defined workflow patterns
- Workflows require user knowledge of which agents to use and when

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `/workflow-feature` command for Feature Development workflow
- [ ] Create `/workflow-bug` command for Bug Fix workflow
- [ ] Create `/workflow-api` command for API Development workflow
- [ ] Create `/workflow-refactor` command for Refactoring workflow
- [ ] Create `/workflow-ui` command for UI Component workflow
- [ ] Create `/workflow-blockchain` command for Blockchain workflow
- [ ] Create `/workflow-qa` command for Quality Assurance workflow
- [ ] Commands accept arguments for task context
- [ ] Commands automatically sequence through appropriate agents
- [ ] Progress tracking integrated with TodoWrite
- [ ] Update documentation to explain workflow commands
- [ ] Test each command with real-world examples

## Technical Requirements
- Commands must use `$ARGUMENTS` to accept user input
- Use Task tool to invoke agents in sequence
- Preserve context between agent invocations
- Include error handling for agent failures
- Support frontmatter configuration

## Priority
High

## Status
Todo

## Implementation Steps
1. Create `.claude/commands/workflows/` directory in template
2. Implement feature development workflow command
3. Test feature workflow with example task
4. Implement remaining workflow commands
5. Add progress tracking with TodoWrite
6. Update README and documentation
7. Create examples for each workflow type
8. Test all workflows end-to-end

## Example Usage
```bash
# Feature Development
/workflow-feature implement shopping cart with add/remove items

# Bug Fix
/workflow-bug fix login timeout after 5 minutes

# API Development
/workflow-api create user management REST API

# Quality Assurance
/workflow-qa test the payment processing system
```

## Benefits
- Transforms manual process into one-command automation
- Reduces cognitive load on users
- Ensures consistent workflow execution
- Makes agent orchestration actually useful
- Improves discoverability of workflows
