# TICKET-004: Agent Orchestration System (Airflow for Agents)

## Description
Design and implement an agent orchestration system that enables complex multi-agent workflows, similar to Apache Airflow but specifically designed for Claude Code agents. This system will allow users to define DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) of agent tasks, manage dependencies, handle parallel execution, and monitor workflow progress.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Define agent workflow specification format (YAML/JSON)
- [x] Support sequential, parallel, and conditional agent execution (sequential ✓, parallel/conditional pending)
- [x] Implement dependency management between agent tasks
- [x] Create workflow executor that manages agent invocations
- [x] Add progress tracking and status monitoring
- [ ] Support error handling and retry mechanisms (basic error handling ✓, retry pending)
- [x] Enable workflow templates for common patterns
- [x] Provide visual workflow representation (text-based)
- [x] Support context passing between agents
- [x] Include workflow validation before execution

## Priority
High

## Status
In Progress (Phase 1 Complete)

## Implementation Steps
- [x] Design workflow specification schema
  - [x] Define task nodes (agent, parameters, dependencies)
  - [ ] Support for conditionals and branching (Phase 3)
  - [x] Context and data passing mechanisms
- [x] Create workflow parser and validator
  - [x] Parse YAML/JSON workflow definitions
  - [x] Validate DAG structure (no cycles)
  - [x] Check agent availability and parameters
- [x] Implement workflow executor engine
  - [x] Task queue management (basic)
  - [ ] Parallel execution support (Phase 2)
  - [x] Dependency resolution
  - [x] State management (pending, running, completed, failed)
- [x] Add context management system
  - [x] Share data between agent tasks
  - [x] Maintain workflow-wide context
  - [x] Support transformations and mappings (basic)
- [x] Create monitoring and visualization
  - [x] Real-time progress tracking
  - [x] Text-based DAG visualization
  - [x] Execution timeline and logs
- [ ] Implement error handling
  - [ ] Retry policies per task (Phase 2)
  - [ ] Failure callbacks (Phase 2)
  - [ ] Partial workflow recovery (Phase 3)
- [x] Build workflow templates library
  - [x] Full-stack development workflow
  - [ ] Code review and testing pipeline
  - [ ] Research and implementation workflow
  - [ ] Bug fix workflow
- [x] Add CLI commands for workflow management
  - [x] `ccworkflow run <workflow-file>`
  - [ ] `ccworkflow status <workflow-id>` (requires persistence)
  - [x] `ccworkflow list`
  - [x] `ccworkflow validate <workflow-file>`
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation
  - [x] Workflow specification guide
  - [x] Template examples
  - [ ] Best practices (Phase 4)

## Technical Details

### Workflow Specification Example
```yaml
name: full-stack-feature
description: Implement a complete feature with planning, backend, frontend, and testing

tasks:
  - id: plan
    agent: planner
    parameters:
      task: "Design user authentication system"
    
  - id: backend
    agent: backend
    dependencies: [plan]
    parameters:
      task: "Implement API endpoints from plan"
      context: "${plan.output}"
    
  - id: frontend
    agent: frontend
    dependencies: [plan]
    parameters:
      task: "Build UI components from plan"
      context: "${plan.output}"
    
  - id: integration
    agent: coder
    dependencies: [backend, frontend]
    parameters:
      task: "Integrate frontend with backend"
    
  - id: test
    agent: checker
    dependencies: [integration]
    parameters:
      task: "Test complete feature"
    retry:
      max_attempts: 2
      
  - id: document
    agent: coder
    dependencies: [test]
    condition: "${test.status} == 'success'"
    parameters:
      task: "Update documentation"

execution:
  max_parallel: 3
  timeout: 3600
  on_failure: stop
```

### Core Components
1. **Workflow Engine**: Manages execution flow and state
2. **Task Scheduler**: Handles parallel execution and queuing
3. **Context Manager**: Passes data between agents
4. **Monitor Service**: Tracks progress and provides visibility
5. **Template Library**: Pre-built workflow patterns

## Dependencies
- All existing agents must be compatible with orchestration
- Need standardized input/output format for agents
- Requires persistent state management for long-running workflows
- Integration with existing Todo system for task tracking

## Notes
- Consider integration with existing orchestrator agent as the workflow executor
- Could leverage existing Todo system for workflow task tracking
- Future enhancements could include:
  - Web UI for workflow design
  - Webhook triggers for workflow execution
  - Integration with external systems (GitHub Actions, CI/CD)
  - Workflow versioning and history

## Phase 1 Summary
Phase 1 has been successfully completed with the following deliverables:
- Core libraries: workflow-schema.js, workflow-parser.js, context-manager.js, execution-engine.js
- CLI interface with validate, run, and list commands
- Example workflows demonstrating the system
- Comprehensive testing and documentation
- Integration with ccsetup tool
