## Important Context

[Add any project-specific context, dependencies, or requirements here]

## Agents

See @agents/README.md for available agents and their purposes

## Agent Orchestration

After adding the agents you want to in `./claude/agents` folder, setup the workflow for Claude code to follow

## Tickets

See @tickets/README.md for ticket format and management approach

### Ticket Management
- **Ticket List**: Maintain @tickets/ticket-list.md as a centralized index of all tickets
- **Update ticket-list.md** whenever you:
  - Create a new ticket (add to appropriate priority section)
  - Change ticket status (update emoji and move if completed)
  - Complete a ticket (move to completed section with date)
- **Status Emojis**: 🔴 Todo | 🟡 In Progress | 🟢 Done | 🔵 Blocked | ⚫ Cancelled

## Plans

See @plans/README.md for planning documents and architectural decisions

## Development Context

- See @docs/ROADMAP.md for current status and next steps
- Task-based development workflow with tickets in `/tickets` directory
- Use `/plans` directory for architectural decisions and implementation roadmaps

## Important Instructions

Before starting any task:

1. **Confirm understanding**: Always confirm you understand the request and outline your plan before proceeding
2. **Ask clarifying questions**: Never make assumptions - ask questions when requirements are unclear
3. **Create planning documents**: Before implementing any code or features, create a markdown file documenting the approach
4. **Use plans directory**: When discussing ideas or next steps, create timestamped files in the plans directory (e.g., `plans/next-steps-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.md`) to maintain a record of decisions
5. **No code comments**: Never add comments to any code you write - code should be self-documenting
6. **Maintain ticket list**: Always update @tickets/ticket-list.md when creating, updating, or completing tickets to maintain a clear project overview
