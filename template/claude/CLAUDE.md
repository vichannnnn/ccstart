## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow existing code conventions in the project
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Maintain clean, readable code

### Testing

- Run tests before committing changes
- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass

### Git Workflow

- Create descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Review changes before committing

## Commit Convention and Pull Request Guidelines

### Commit Message Format
Follow the conventional commits specification:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (updating dependencies, build process, etc.)
- `perf`: Performance improvements

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality
fix(api): handle null values in user response
docs: update API documentation for book endpoints
refactor(frontend): extract BookTable into separate components
chore(deps): update FastAPI to 0.104.1
```

### Pull Request Guidelines

**PR Title**: Use the same format as commit messages

**PR Description Template:**
```markdown

## Important Context

[Add any project-specific context, dependencies, or requirements here]

## Agents

See @claude/agents/README.md for available agents and their purposes

## Agent Orchestration

After adding the agents you want to in `./claude/agents` folder, setup the workflow for Claude code to follow

## Custom Commands

Custom slash commands are available in `.claude/commands/`:
- **/update-claude-md** - Automatically updates this file with project-specific information
- See `.claude/commands/README.md` for creating your own commands

## Tickets

See @claude/tickets/README.md for ticket format and management approach

### Ticket Management
- **Ticket List**: Maintain @claude/tickets/ticket-list.md as a centralized index of all tickets
- **Update ticket-list.md** whenever you:
  - Create a new ticket (add to appropriate priority section)
  - Change ticket status (update emoji and move if completed)
  - Complete a ticket (move to completed section with date)
- **Status Emojis**: ðŸ”´ Todo | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | ðŸŸ¢ Done | ðŸ”µ Blocked | âš« Cancelled

## Plans

See @claude/plans/README.md for planning documents and architectural decisions

## Development Context

- See @claude/docs/ROADMAP.md for current status and next steps
- Task-based development workflow with tickets in `claude/tickets` directory
- Use `claude/plans` directory for architectural decisions and implementation roadmaps

## Important Instructions

Before starting any task:

1. **Confirm understanding**: Always confirm you understand the request and outline your plan before proceeding
2. **Ask clarifying questions**: Never make assumptions - ask questions when requirements are unclear
3. **Create planning documents**: Before implementing any code or features, create a markdown file documenting the approach
4. **Use plans directory**: When discussing ideas or next steps, create timestamped files in the plans directory (e.g., `claude/plans/next-steps-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.md`) to maintain a record of decisions
5. **No code comments**: Never add comments to any code you write - code should be self-documenting
6. **Maintain ticket list**: Always update @claude/tickets/ticket-list.md when creating, updating, or completing tickets to maintain a clear project overview
